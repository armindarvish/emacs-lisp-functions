** Handy or fun functions for Emacs

   
*** pdf-avy-highlight.el
This is a function that uses avy to highlight by keyboard with pdf-tools. After
calling the function you type the initial pattern to set where to highlight
from, and subsequently type the number of it's label. Then repeat this to set
the end of the highlighted region. It works fine, but I concluded that using
the mouse is maybe sometimes not that bad :wink:.

In the demo below the first highlight is created using the mouse, while the
second is created using pdf-avy-highlight (both slowly, so you can follow what
happens)

*** google-keyboard-translate-pdf-textregion.el
    Translate text-regions in pdf by keyboard (similar to ~pdf-avy-highlight.el~
    decribed above). Requires https://github.com/atykhonov/google-translate
    
*** pdf-continuous-scroll.el
See [[https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools/issues/27#issuecomment-696237353][here]]
and the enhanced minor mode version 
[[https://github.com/dalanicolai/pdf-continuous-scroll-mode.el][here]]

** doc-view-continuous-scroll-djvu.el
   *DOES NOT WORK WELL*. pdf-continuous-scroll.el ported to doc-view-mode.
   However, it worked well until (experimental) functions were added to make it
   sync with djvu.el buffers. So although it could easily made to work with all
   doc-view buffers by removing the djvu specific functions, it currently only
   works with djvu documents.

*** doc-view-continuous-scroll.el
    Very quick attempt to revert =doc-view-continuous-scroll-djvu.el= to a
    working state for doc-view.


*** evil-switch.el
    A simplified equivalent of the [[https://github.com/AndrewRadev/switch.vim][vim-switch plugin]].

    convenient navigation using imenu.
*** toc-mode [[https://github.com/dalanicolai/toc-mode]]
